    "Identity design for the National Archaeological Museum (Madrid), based on the concept of connecting 
    past and present through technology."
---

The National Archaeological Museum (Madrid) is a public institution whose objective is to offer all 
citizens a rigorous, attractive, interesting, and critical interpretation of the meaning of objects 
that belonged to different peoples of the Mediterranean area, from Antiquity to recent times. In this 
way, knowledge of our history will be useful for analyzing and understanding current reality. The 
museum advocates for easy access to culture through technology.

*Concept*

Connection past and present through technology. It starts from the minimal geometric expression of the 
square (referring to the pixel) to create compositions.
