    "Independent publication on artistic research that focuses on studying the creation 
    and contemporary culture of the Andalusian scene"
---

Independent publication on artistic research that focuses on studying the contemporary 
culture of the Andalusian scene. It focuses on the dissemination of artists, both local 
and resident and all those who have been attracted and influenced by Andalusian culture. 
Each issue revolves around a concept, which is contextualized and linked to the artists 
of the issue.

El hervidero deals with the cultural sense of belonging that the Andalusian territory has 
experienced during the last decades. It covers topics of awareness around supporting the
neighborhood, small businesses, and the interest in discovering and supporting local art.

NÂº1 - Identities

In this issue, we will talk about artists who take their own roots as artistic inspiration 
to address personal and identity issues. Some, in the form of self-portraits, tell how their 
culture has defined them as people and therefore has given narrative to their work. Passion, 
family, singing, sexuality, and gender will be the protagonists in this issue.
